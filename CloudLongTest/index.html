        <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
        <p>Cloud computing delivers computing services over the internet, providing on-demand access to resources like servers, storage, and software without owning physical infrastructure. It offers benefits like scalability, cost-efficiency, and flexibility through service models such as IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. Users can rapidly provision, scale, and pay for resources as needed, making it integral to modern IT infrastructure.</p>
